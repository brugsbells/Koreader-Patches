# Koreader-Patches
Some Koreader patches I've made for myselft.

## 2-disable-wifi-notifications.lua
Removes all pop-up notifications when connecting to Wi-Fi networks

## 2-uniform-cover-size.lua
Resizes book covers in Mosaic view so they are all the same size

## 2-series-badge.lua
Adds a badge to book covers that shows the series number. The series number must be in the file name inside brackets like this: "Mistborn [01] Final Empire, The - Brandon Sanderson.epub"
